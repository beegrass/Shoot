    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p><bold>Alignment</bold> refers to arranging 
    elements in a way that creates order and organization on your site.
    In web design, tools like grids, columns and flexbox enforce proper
    alignment.

            <bold>Text Consistency:</bold> Ensure that Text
            elements such as headings, body text, and buttons are properly
            aligned, creating a clear visual flow that guides the user's eye
            across the page

        <li>
            <bold>UI Design:</bold> Buttons, icons, and navigation menus should align
            with other page elements, ensuring a clean and structured layout. Proper alignment
            reinforces a sense of order and organization.

            Aligning elements horizontally or vertically ensures that the page doesn't feel chaotic,
            improving readability and visual appeal.

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        A site's accessibility is improved through proper alignment, as it creates
        predictable interaction areas. With this, users with motor impairments can 
        find and interact with certain elements without confusion. An example of 
        proper alignment is keeping the form fields aligned across different pages
        to reduce the effort to navigate through the form. It is important; however, 
        to responsibly implement center-aligning text. This alignment is often good for 
        a small amount of text, but it could decrease how readable your site is when 
        used for bigger chunks.
